                <p>Just another person enjoying the wonders of this world. Ive always had an interest in programming growing up I loved watching movies with rogue programmers, like hackers and Matrix. I realized I love building things when I was in high school and that just made my thirst for programming more intense Its been a long journey to get here, but I finally started. Check out my projects.</p>
